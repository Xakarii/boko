Technologies: Javascript

Features : 

User story : Web based online games with a casino theme.
GUI : Some graphical representation of interactions in game.

Javascript: What we've learned
	As a team, we have chosen to use javascript in order to make sure our implementation of our game goes hand and hand with our website/HTML. However, none of us are fluent in Javascript and HTML/CSS. But through research, we've been able to dive deeper into Javascript learning about libaries to use to help us in our project.


Project Status:
The first game for our site is Blackjack and it is functioning.  Next steps involve adding card graphics, animations, and betting functions.
